# Classifier

Python and NumPy implementation from scratch of machine learning algorithms used for classification.

The training set with ***N*** elements is defined as ***D={(X1, y1), . . ., (XN, yN)}***, where ***X*** is a vector and ***y={0, 1}*** is one-hot encoded.

Sample code at the end of each file.

The **Neural_Network_Derivatives.pdf** document contains calculation of the derivatives used in code, except for the logistic regression that uses Yaoliang Yu lecture notes - see reference.

The **optimization** folder contains first and second order methods used in machine learning backpropagation.

### Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge professor Clodoaldo A. Moraes Lima for his guidance and support during the machine learning course at Universidade de Sao Paulo.
